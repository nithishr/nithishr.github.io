At [KI labs](www.ki-labs.com), we faced the problem of shortage of keys. To solve this problem, we connected the intercom system in the office to the internet using a Raspberry Pi which could then be controlled from Slack. It was interesting to see this turning into a platform of sorts with multiple teams working on further integrations like mobile apps, face detection based authentication, etc.
