Hodor: Controlling the office door from the Internet
-----
At [KI labs](www.ki-labs.com), we faced the problem of shortage of keys. To solve this problem, we connected the intercom system in the office to the internet using a Raspberry Pi which could then be controlled from Slack. It was interesting to see this turning into a platform of sorts with multiple teams working on further integrations like mobile apps, face detection based authentication, etc.

Just a Little Longer: Hardware based Parental Control System for Kids
-----
This was developed over the weekend during Code TwentyFour, hackathon organized by ProSieben in Munich. JaLL enables kids to consume content on smartphones or smart TVs using physical coins based on NFC similar to a piggy bank. Parents could monitor and set limits on what content could be consumed by the kids. 

This project was adjudged the best project at the hackathon :)
