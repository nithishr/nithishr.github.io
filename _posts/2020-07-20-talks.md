There are many problems that we face in our day to day life. Many of them can be solved rapidly by using a combination of readily available technologies. In this talk, I explain how we solved the shortage of keys in our office using the power of Internet of Things & cloud services.

We faced a shortage of keys for the people in the office. It was really frustrating to open the door multiple times during the day and not to mention the loss of flow while working. We solved this problem by connecting the intercom in the office to the internet using a Raspberry Pi.

In this talk, I explain the challenges we faced & how we overcame them like exposing the service running on Raspberry Pi, security, adding support for multiple clients like Slack, cross-platform mobile apps, Siri commands, etc. The solutions are all simple services which are free or inexpensive to use.

Tutorial: Scraping Data from the Web using Scrapy & Beautiful Soup
-----
Date : November 8th 2017

Event: [Pydata Munich](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Munchen/events/244723959/)

[Code](https://github.com/nithishr/meetup_scraping)

There is a lot of data out there on the internet, but it's not always in an easy-to-consume format. Luckily, there are a lot of "web scraping" tools out there to help us! These tools take the data and put it into a more structured format, like CSV or Excel. This tutorial showcased how to use Scrapy and BeautifulSoup, two powerful web scraping packages for Python, to grab and collect customer contact information from yellow pages web sites! The session included live coding the scraper for a classifieds website.
