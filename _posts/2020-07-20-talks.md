Creating Data Apps using Pure Python: Building Custom Apps using Streamlit
----
Date: 7th February 2021

Event: [FOSDEM '21](https://2020.devrel.net/)

Have you always wanted a flexible & interactive visualization that is easy for others to work with without handling all the Javascript libraries? Or do you want to build a user interface for your Machine Learning Model? This talk has you covered with building data apps in Python using Streamlit with examples of a Travel Visualization App using Google Maps Data & an UI for the ImageNet Model.

In this talk, I showcase couple of different use cases where you can build your data focussed applications using Streamlit, an open source library in pure Python.

In the first use case, I cover how you can build interactive dashboards using different Streamlit components. These dashboards can be easily deployed & the consumers can easily work with the interactive dashboards without worrying about all the dependencies that need to be installed to run the Jupyter notebooks. In the showcase, I will go over how you can build a dashboard of your historical travels using Google Maps Location History including some memories from them from Flickr.

In the second showcase, I will describe how users can create a quick interface for their machine learning model using Streamlit. These interfaces are much faster to develop than building a custom frontend interface for machine learning models with the help of Javascript libraries. In the demo, I showcase how I built an UI for the ImageNet Model.

The showcases will showcase how these data based web apps can be built using Python functions & Streamlit components.

Learnings from Organizing Internal Hackathons
----
Date: 30th July 2020

Event: [DevRelCon Earth 2020](https://2020.devrel.net/)

The talk summarizes some of the learnings from organizing internal hackathons including the motivation, processes & the outcomes from it. This was based on the internal hackathon, [KI hacks]({% post_url 2019-10-02-ki-hacks %}), organized at KI labs. This was delivered virtually during DevRelCon Earth 2020.

There are many problems that we face in our day to day life. Many of them can be solved rapidly by using a combination of readily available technologies. In this talk, I explain how we solved the shortage of keys in our office using the power of Internet of Things & cloud services.

We faced a shortage of keys for the people in the office. It was really frustrating to open the door multiple times during the day and not to mention the loss of flow while working. We solved this problem by connecting the intercom in the office to the internet using a Raspberry Pi.

In this talk, I explain the challenges we faced & how we overcame them like exposing the service running on Raspberry Pi, security, adding support for multiple clients like Slack, cross-platform mobile apps, Siri commands, etc. The solutions are all simple services which are free or inexpensive to use.

Tutorial: Scraping Data from the Web using Scrapy & Beautiful Soup
-----
Date : November 8th 2017

Event: [Pydata Munich](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Munchen/events/244723959/)

[Code](https://github.com/nithishr/meetup_scraping)

There is a lot of data out there on the internet, but it's not always in an easy-to-consume format. Luckily, there are a lot of "web scraping" tools out there to help us! These tools take the data and put it into a more structured format, like CSV or Excel. This tutorial showcased how to use Scrapy and BeautifulSoup, two powerful web scraping packages for Python, to grab and collect customer contact information from yellow pages web sites! The session included live coding the scraper for a classifieds website.
